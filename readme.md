- This is a project by Olina Liang for the data science class. Created in 2018.
- This website analyzes the SkyServer DR14 data: http://www.sdss.org/.
- Clustering methods k-means and hierarchical clustering are used to seperate the 12,557 data about galaxies into 5 clusters.
- In this app, users can select the clustering method and display random images from one cluster. Images are acquired from http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr14/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx using the coordinates of galaxies from the dataset. Also, user can do image thresholding and analyze number of objects in app.
